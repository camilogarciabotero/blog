# Introduction

This is my first Tidy Tuesday contribution and will be playing around a little bit with  the coffee rating data.

As a coffee lover I felt that exploring a dataset about coffee was mandatory. The first question that came to me mind was: what is the best coffee and eventually, as looking a little bit deeper into dataset, which country has the best coffees.

I decided then to compare coffee ratings across countries and the associated density of cups rated. Among the main findings it shows that one Ethiopian coffee came to be the best ranked and also that this country's coffees are the best ranked while Haitian coffees show one of the widest range of ratings. Colombian coffee display a moderately good ratings and a very narrow range.
